## Live Demo

You can view and try the **One Page Calendar Generator** live [Here](https://aayushbhusari.github.io/one-page-calendar-generator/)

## Idea

The **One Page Calendar** project is designed to provide a comprehensive calendar layout for any given year, all displayed on a single page. It offers a visually organized and easy-to-read calendar structure that shows the months and their corresponding days. The goal is to help users quickly generate and view a complete year's worth of dates without having to navigate through multiple pages.

## Example

## Project Overview

The **One Page Calendar Generator** is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input a year and automatically generates a calendar for that year displayed in a tabular format. The calendar will display:

- **Month Names**: All months of the year listed.
- **Days of the Week**: Properly aligned with the correct starting days of each month.
- **Dates**: Each date of the month aligned with the correct weekday.

### Key Features

- **Year Input**: Users can enter any valid year to generate the corresponding calendar.
- **Generated Calendar**: The calendar will display a full year, with each month's starting day and all the dates for each month.
- **Downloadable Calendar**: Once the calendar is generated, users can download the calendar as a high-quality image (JPG format).

### How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user provides a valid year in the input field.
2. **Generate Calendar**: Upon pressing the "Generate Calendar" button, the calendar for that year is generated and displayed on the page.
3. **Download**: After generating the calendar, the user can click the "Download Calendar" button to download the generated calendar as an image (JPG format).
